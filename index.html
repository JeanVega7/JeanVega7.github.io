  <h2>
    About Me
  </h2>
    <p>
      My full name is Jean Carlos Vega Santiago. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. My family moved to the United States when I was 10 years old. As long as I have been in school I have been fascinated by math and science.
      <br />
      <br /> 
      In my spare time, I enjoy playing plenty of video games on my PlayStation especially first-person shooters such as Call of Duty or Rainbow Six Siege. However, there are other games that I also try from time to time, more recently being the popular game Fortnite. I mainly enjoy playing video games with friends but I don't mind getting competitive either. At FGCU, I am a memeber of the FGCU Quidditch team and it has been a blast so far and everyone on the team has become like a family to me. The sport is intense and rather physical but thats the fun of the game.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am 19 years old and currently a freshmen at Florida Gulf Coast University planning to major in Software Engineering and minor in Mathematics.
